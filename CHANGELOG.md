## [Unreleased]

### Added
- GPU acceleration for local Whisper transcription via Vulkan (AMD/NVIDIA), enabled by default
  - CPU-only builds via `--no-default-features`
  - Override the runtime backend with `WHISPER_BACKEND` (`cpu`/`vulkan`) and `WHISPER_GPU_DEVICE`

### Dependencies
- Bumped `whisper-rs` 0.15 → 0.16 (newer whisper.cpp; bindgen 0.72)
  - Builds cleanly with modern clang (e.g. clang 22) — no `LIBCLANG_PATH` workaround needed

### Changed
- Fast startup is now the default (~100ms instead of ~1600ms)
  - Recording starts immediately with asynchronous beep playback
  - Any captured startup beep is automatically trimmed during processing
  - No flag required

## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-25

### Added
- Initial release of waystt - Wayland Speech-to-Text Tool
- Signal-driven speech-to-text with dual output modes:
  - SIGUSR1: Direct text typing via ydotool 
  - SIGUSR2: Clipboard copy for manual pasting
- OpenAI Whisper API integration for high-quality transcription
- Continuous background audio recording with PipeWire/CPAL
- Musical audio feedback system with configurable beeps:
  - Recording start: "Ding dong" (C4 → E4)
  - Recording stop: "Dong ding" (E4 → C4)
  - Success: "Ding ding" (E4 → E4)
  - Error: Warbling tone for failures
- Persistent clipboard daemon for clipboard operations
- Comprehensive configuration via environment variables
- Support for multiple audio backends (PipeWire, PulseAudio, ALSA)
- Cross-platform Wayland compatibility (tested on Hyprland, Niri)
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks and retry mechanisms

### System Requirements
- **Audio System**: PipeWire (recommended) or PulseAudio/ALSA
- **Text Input**: ydotool for direct typing functionality
- **Clipboard**: wtype for clipboard operations
- **Environment**: Wayland display server
- **API**: OpenAI API key for Whisper transcription

### Configuration Options
